Hello world,

I'm learning how to write in a text editor within terminal on my mac.

Nothing special here except this is near the fifth time I've done so, and 
have yet to dissapoint myself.

edison style, ive succeeded in the exact amount of times i have failed.

lets see if I can add to git

after all this nonsense, I still don't get it

Applying new text.
